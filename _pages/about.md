I am **Yi Tian**, an M.Sc. student in **Biomedical Informatics at the National University of Singapore (NUS)** (2025–2027). My prior training and research focus on **medical image processing**, particularly **computational pathology** (e.g., **cell detection** and **instance segmentation**), where I develop efficient, structure-aware methods for small and densely packed objects. I continue to maintain a strong interest in **medical image analysis**, especially pathology-related detection and segmentation problems.

Building on this imaging foundation, I am **actively exploring multimodal medical AI**, with an interest in **medical multimodal models** adapted from strong general-purpose multimodal backbones (e.g., models with long-context reasoning and tool use) for clinical settings. In parallel, I am also exploring **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** and **tool-augmented medical LLM systems** to improve factual grounding, reliability, and workflow integration when working with **medical images, clinical text (reports/notes), structured health data, and external knowledge sources (e.g., guidelines and literature)**.

My recent work includes **CellMamba**, a lightweight adaptive cell detection framework with a full Mamba backbone (first-author, **BMVC 2025**), and **Direction-Guided Watershed** for adherent cell instance segmentation (first-author, **ISBI 2026**). I also contribute to medical segmentation and domain generalization studies (e.g., **MIDL 2024**, **ISBI 2025**) and am conducting a **systematic review on semantic alignment for multimodal medical AI**.

I am currently **seeking a Summer 2026 research internship** in **medical multimodal models / vision-language learning / RAG & tool-augmented medical LLM systems**, and I would be excited to contribute to projects that connect methodological innovation with real-world clinical impact.
